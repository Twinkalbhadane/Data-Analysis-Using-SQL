# Data-Analysis-Using-SQL
I'll use this script to provide introduction to data analysis using SQL language, which should be a must tool for every data scientist - both for getting access to data, but more interesting, as a simple tool for advance data analysis. 
The logic behind SQL is very similar to any other tool or language that used for data analysis (excel, Pandas), and for those that used to work with data, should be very intuitive.
